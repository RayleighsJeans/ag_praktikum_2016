	abstract={Time–space-resolved optical emission spectroscopy was used for the investigation of a diffuse dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) in helium and in 95%He + 5%H 2 gas mixture. The DBD in helium was diffuse in the whole range of the applied voltage, while in the gas mixture the discharge operated in diffuse mode only in the regime with more than three current peaks. In the helium discharge, the excitation of hydrogen H β is delayed compared with the excitation of the helium atomic line, while in the gas mixture both lines are excited simultaneously. Using the Stark polarization spectroscopy technique based on the He I 492.19 nm line and its forbidden counterpart, the electric field distribution (EFD) was measured in the cathode region of the DBD in helium and in the helium–hydrogen mixture. Electric field space distributions in both gas discharges, obtained at 20 kPa pressure, showed linear decreasing in the cathode region, which is a typical characteristic of the glow discharge. Linear fits of the EFDs showed that the length of the cathode fall region is smaller in the gas mixture than in pure helium. In the multiple current peak mode of the DBD, EFD was measured during each of the three current peaks and no noticeable difference between them is observed.}

Electric field strength was measured using Stark polarization emission spectroscopy. Investigations were performed at 200 and 800 mbar pressures. It was found that the electric field strength was higher at the higher pressure while cathode fall length was shorter. During the whole discharge development period the length of the cathode fall region decreases. An interesting result is that in the period of current decrease, the maximum of the electric field distribution shifts away from the cathode showing the accumulation of negative charge near the cathode surface.}

	abstract={A stationary collisional-radiative model for helium microwave discharges in cylindrical geometry is developed by coupling the rate balance equations for the n<or=6 excited states of helium to the continuity and transport equations for the electrons, He + atomic ions and He 2 + molecular ions, and to the homogeneous Boltzmann equation. The latter is solved using the DC effective field approximation but taking into account stepwise inelastic and superelastic processes from the 2 3 S, 2 1 S and 2 3 P states, as well as electron-electron collisions. A coherent set of electron cross sections is deduced in order to solve the Boltzmann equation. Special attention is paid to the atomic collisions considered (by taking into account /-change reactions and associative ionization reactions), and to the effects of radiation imprisonment. This, together with the inclusion of the kinetics of the molecular ions, allows the range of validity of the model to extend up to atmospheric pressure. The theoretical populations for the excited states, characteristics for the steady-state reduced maintenance electric field and mean absorbed power per electron at unit gas density agree very well with experimental data from surface wave discharges.}

	abstract={A spectroscopic method for the measurement of macroscopic electric field strength in discharges, based on Stark shifts of several helium emission lines with their forbidden counterparts, is presented. The shifts of forbidden and allowed π components are calculated for eight line groups of helium. For practical use, polynomial functions are provided for the shifts of line groups applicable in the visible range. The method is an extension and improvement of a previously established method for two line groups. Line fitting procedures are presented that take into account components of a given helium line group, provide higher accuracy compared to simple evaluation, and enable measurements of lower field values. The method and fitting procedure were experimentally tested and verified by measuring the field distribution in the cathode fall of a low pressure glow discharge. Due to its ab initio basis the presented method can be used for measuring electric field distributions in various types of discharges, independently of other plasma parameters and fulfillment of special conditions.}

	abstract={As a logical extension to previous investigations of the barrier discharge (BD) in helium and nitrogen, the present work reports on the operation in any mixtures of both pure gases. Using a well-established plane-parallel discharge cell configuration allows to study the influence of the He/N 2 mixing ratio on the formation of different discharge modes. Their characterization was made by measuring the discharge emission development together with the formation and decay of surface charges on a bismuth silicon oxide (Bi 12 SiO 20 , BSO) crystal. This was realized by the simultaneous application of the spatio-temporally resolved optical emission spectroscopy, and the electro-optic Pockels effect in combination with a CCD high speed camera. The existence diagram for diffuse and filamentary BDs was determined by varying the amplitude and shape of the applied voltage. Over the entire range of the He/N 2 ratio, the diffuse mode can be operated at moderate voltage amplitudes whereas filamentation occurs at significant overvoltage and is favoured by a high voltage slew rate. Irrespective of the discharge mode, the overall charge transfer during a discharge breakdown is found to be in excellent agreement with the amount of accumulated surface charges. An exponential decay of the surface charge deposited on the BSO crystal is induced by LED illumination beyond a typical discharge cycle. During the decay process, a broadening of the radial profiles of positive as well as negative surface charge spots originating from previous microdischarges is observed. The investigations contribute to a better understanding of the charge accumulation at a dielectric.}

	abstract={Fluid models of gas discharges require the input of transport coefficients and rate coefficients that depend on the electron energy distribution function. Such coefficients are usually calculated from collision cross-section data by solving the electron Boltzmann equation (BE). In this paper we present a new user-friendly BE solver developed especially for this purpose, freely available under the name BOLSIG+, which is more general and easier to use than most other BE solvers available. The solver provides steady-state solutions of the BE for electrons in a uniform electric field, using the classical two-term expansion, and is able to account for different growth models, quasi-stationary and oscillating fields, electron–neutral collisions and electron–electron collisions. We show that for the approximations we use, the BE takes the form of a convection-diffusion continuity-equation with a non-local source term in energy space. To solve this equation we use an exponential scheme commonly used for convection-diffusion problems. The calculated electron transport coefficients and rate coefficients are defined so as to ensure maximum consistency with the fluid equations. We discuss how these coefficients are best used in fluid models and illustrate the influence of some essential parameters and approximations.}

	abstract={Glow dielectric barrier discharge (GDBD) appears as an attractive solution to realise an atmospheric pressure cold plasma process suitable for all the surface treatments including thin film coatings. Such a development requires a large understanding of the GDBD physics and chemistry. The objective of this work is to contribute to that understanding. From the analysis of electrical measurements, time resolved emission spectroscopy, short exposure time pictures and numerical model results, it is shown that GDBD which are discharges due to a Townsend initiation and not to a streamer coupling, transit from Townsend to subnormal glow discharge during the current increase. Depending on the maximum current density, they can be considered as a glow or a Townsend discharge. In a glow discharge, the memory effect from one discharge to the following one is based on electrons and ions trapped in the positive column while in a Townsend discharge, it is metastables which stay in the gas and create electrons through cathode secondary emission. In all the cases, the ionisation has to be slowed down by a significant contribution of Penning ionisation.}

Efficient and cost-effective all-solid-state power supplies are available. The preferred frequency range lies between 1 kHz and 10 MHz, the preferred pressure range between 10 kPa and 500 kPa. Industrial applications include ozone generation, pollution control, surface treatment, high power CO2 lasers, ultraviolet excimer lamps, excimer based mercury-free fluorescent lamps, and flat large-area plasma displays.

	abstract = {Numerical calculations of spatio-temporal characteristics of the homogeneous barrier discharge in helium are performed by means of a one-dimensional fluid model. The influence of the elementary processes on the discharge behaviour is studied by variation of the corresponding rate constants. The simulation and the analytical interpretation are carried out for two basic modes of the homogeneous barrier discharge, i.e. the Townsend and glow modes. The Townsend discharge is characterized by the absence of quasineutral plasma; several current peaks may occur during the half-cycle. The oscillations of the current are caused by a lag between the ion production nearby the anode and the subsequent ion–electron emission on the cathode. The specificity of the glow discharge is the development of a cathode region and a positive column during the breakdown, as well as the presence of quasineutral plasma in subsequent phases. The positive column occurs because the shielding of the external field by the plasma is not instantaneous. The dependence of the discharge behaviour on the external parameters, such as the amplitude and frequency of the applied voltage, discharge gap width, and thickness of dielectric barriers, is analysed. The mode of the discharge is governed mostly by the gap width and barrier thickness and depends weakly on the amplitude and frequency of the applied voltage. As the barriers are thin and the discharge gap is sufficiently wide, the glow mode occurs; otherwise, the discharge is Townsend.}
